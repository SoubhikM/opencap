# Instructions

`write_iwfmt.bash` should be executed in the `WORK` directory of a Columbus calculation, and the $COLUMBUS environment variable should point towards a valid installation of Columbus. The resulting human readable .iwfmt formatted files can be parsed by `pyopencap.analysis.colparser`.

# Acknowledgements
* The `write_iwfmt.bash` script was adapted from [Theodore-QC](https://github.com/felixplasser/theodore-qc).
